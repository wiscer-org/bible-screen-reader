# Luke 8

## The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector

**9** He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were
righteous and looked down on everyone else:

**10** Two men went up to the temple to pray,one a Pharisee and the other a tax
collector.

**11** The Pharisee was standingand praying like this about himself: "God, I
thank you that I’m not like other people—greedy,unrighteous,adulterers,or even
like this tax collector.

**12** I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of everything I get."

**13** “But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even raise his eyes
to heavenbut kept striking his chestand saying, "God, have mercy on me, a
sinner!"

**14** I tell you, this one went down to his house justified rather than the
other, because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who
humbles himself will be exalted.”
