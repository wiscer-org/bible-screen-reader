        <h1>Genesis 1</h1>

        <p>1. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</p>

        <p>
            2. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness covered the
            surface of the watery depths, and the Spirit of God was hovering
            over the surface of the waters.
        </p>

        <p>3. Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.</p>

        <p>4. God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.</p>

        <p>5. God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” There was an evening, and there was a morning: one day.</p>

        <p>6. Then God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, separating water from water.”</p>
