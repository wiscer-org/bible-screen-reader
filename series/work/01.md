## Genesis 1

**26** Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.
They will rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, the
whole earth, and the creatures that crawl on the earth.”

**27** So God created man in his own image; he created him in the image of God;
he created them male and female.

**28** God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the
earth, and subdue it. Rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every
creature that crawls on the earth.”

## Genesis 2

**15** The Lord God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to work it
and watch over it.

## Romans 12

### A Living Sacrifice

**1** Therefore, brothers and sisters, in view of the mercies of God, I urge you
to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is
your true worship.

**2** Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of
your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will
of God. Many Gifts but One Body

## Colossians 3

**23** Whatever you do, do it from the heart, as something done for the Lord and
not for people,

**24** knowing that you will receive the reward of an inheritance from the Lord.
You serve the Lord Christ.
