## Ecclesiastes 2:17–23 (CSB)

**17** Therefore, I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was
distressing to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind.

**18** I hated all my work that I labored at under the sun because I must leave
it to the one who comes after me.

**19** And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will take over
all my work that I labored at skillfully under the sun. This too is futile.

**20** So I began to give myself over to despair concerning all my work that I
had labored at under the sun.

**21** When there is a person whose work was done with wisdom, knowledge, and
skill, and he must give his portion to a person who has not worked for it, this
too is futile and a great wrong.

**22** For what does a person get with all his work and all his efforts that he
labors at under the sun?

**23** For all his days are filled with grief, and his occupation is sorrowful;
even at night, his mind does not rest. This too is futile.

## 1 Corinthians 15:51–58 (CSB)

**51** Listen, I am telling you a mystery: We will not all fall asleep, but we
will all be changed,

**52** in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the
trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be
changed.

**53** For this corruptible body must be clothed with incorruptibility, and this
mortal body must be clothed with immortality.

**54** When this corruptible body is clothed with incorruptibility, and this
mortal body is clothed with immortality, then the saying that is written will
take place:\
Death has been swallowed up in victory.

**55** Where, death, is your victory?\
Where, death, is your sting?

**56** The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.

**57** But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ!

**58** Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, be steadfast, immovable, always
excelling in the Lord’s work, because you know that your labor in the Lord is
not in vain.
